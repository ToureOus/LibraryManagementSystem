Python Library Management System
Create a class called Book to represent a book. Each book has the following attributes: ISBN
number, title, authors (can be more than one), publisher, publication date and price.
The class should provide the following methods:
1. Get the book details from the user (using input commands).
2. __str__() method that returns all the information about the book.
In addition, create a class called Library. A library stores a collection of books and has
the following operations:
1. Add a book to the library. This method should take O(1) time.
2. Remove a book from the library. This method should take O(1) time.
3. Display all the books in the library.
4. Search for a specific book by its ISBN. This method should take O(1) time.
5. Search for books written by a specific author.
6. Search for books that cost less than a specific price.
In the main script, display a menu to the user that will allow them to choose any of the
above operations (add a book, remove a book, etc.).
